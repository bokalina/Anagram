Anagram
---

Two words are anagrams if those words contain same letters. For example `abba` and `baba` are anagrams.
a) Devise the function `are_anagrams(a, b)` in Python and `areAnagrams(a, b)` in JavaScript, to check if two strings are anagrams.
b) Provide screen shots of how You implemented the function in the interactive interpreter and the result of testing it with `assert` for both Python and JavaScript.  
c) What is complexity of the solution You devised?
d) Can you devise one-liner that solves the problem?
e) Develop "Anagram Web App" that enables end user to enter two words and send request to the API endpoint that checks if words are anagrams and returns result that is displayed to the end user.
